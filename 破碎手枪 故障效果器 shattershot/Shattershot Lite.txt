A freeware version of something bigger and badder to come. :)

Just play with it, it's 2:35AM right now, I'm too tired to explain it all.  Click on the SLICE word menu and more options appear, pay attention to the tooltips, TRY THE PRESETS ON DRUMS.

FEEDBACK APPRECIATED...

Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't.

This is your first Christmas present from DarkWare, more to come as long as I stay in a decent mood. ;)

Love and respect to all the aural marauders out there in cyberland.
